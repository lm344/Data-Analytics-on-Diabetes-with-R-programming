# Data-Analytics-on-Diabetes-with-R-programming
-> Data Set:
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has
diabetes.

-> Objective:
The purpose of this data set mining implementation is to extrapolate the factors triggering diabetes
from ‘number of times pregnant’ and other attributes. The analysis will also explain which
variables leads to diabetes.

-> Attributes and Source:
• Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
• Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hour in an oral glucose tolerance test
• Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
• Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
• Insulin: 2-hour Serum insulin (mu U/ml)
• BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/ (height in m) ^2)
• Diabetes Pedigree Function: Diabetes Pedigree function
• Age: Age in years
• Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

-> Data Analytical Model:
The Data Analytical technique used for this model is Logistic Regression. The reason to choose
this technique was the target variable being the type ‘binomial’, so Logistic regression will be the
best fit. Furthermore, this type of regression will give a better view of the driver variables driving
the target with high approximate value.
